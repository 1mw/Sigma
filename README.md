# Sigma

### Description
Sigma is a tool to help people learn to program. It allows people who have never programmed before to write a program.

### Details
Sigma is a GUI for the Sigma Framework. The Sigma Framework allows you to dynamically create theoretical Java objects, put them together, and extract a full and runnable Java source file (.java). Both Sigma and the Sigma Framework are being developed in this project.

Both Sigma and the Sigma Framework are written in Java. A Sigma script consists of a SigmaClass and any object or method in that class. Please see the demos (com.markaldrich.sigma.demo) to see how it works and use correct formatting.
